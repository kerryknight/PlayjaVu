/// is some problem with the object such that it can't be saved, it will be
/// silently discarded. If the save completes successfully while the object is
/// still in memory, then callback will be called.
///
/// Objects saved with this method will be stored locally in an on-disk cache
/// until they can be delivered to Parse. They will be sent immediately if
/// possible. Otherwise, they will be sent the next time a network connection is
/// available. Objects saved this way will persist even after the app is closed,
/// in which case they will be sent the next time the app is opened.  If more
/// than 10MB of data is waiting to be sent, subsequent calls to saveEventually
/// will cause old saves to be silently discarded until the connection can be
/// re-established, and the queued objects can be saved.
